<h5>1.1.1 Multiplication, Division, and Power operations</h5>
<p>To use the multiplication function we have defined an "interpret_multiplizieren" function. The function only accepts a list, but the list must have at least 3 elements, the first one must be "multiplizieren" so that the lgl and gsc file have the same language. Next, you must have at least 2 either intergers or floats in the list and the function gives us the multiplication of these intergers or floats.<br>
