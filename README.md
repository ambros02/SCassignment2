<h5>1.1.1 Multiplication, Division, and Power operations</h5>
<p>To use the multiplication function we have defined an "interpret_multiplizieren" function. The function only accepts a list, but the list must have at least 3 elements, the first one must be "multiplizieren" so that the lgl and gsc file have the same language. Next, you must have at least 2 either intergers or floats in the list and the function gives us the multiplication of these intergers or floats.<br>
The division function works in a similar way. The difference is that it list must have 3 elements. The first element "dividieren" and either interger or floats as dividend and divisor. We also make sure that we the divisor is not equal 0.<br>
The power function is called "hoch" like in the german language. The list also must have 3 elements, the first "hoch" and then again interger or floats as base and power.
